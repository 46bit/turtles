# Turtles
Minecraft ComputerCraft scripts for high-efficiency Turtle excavation.

The default Turtle `excavate` and `hole` commands are inefficient. They often make unnecessary movements to reposition, allowing simple code. My scripts are designed to make the absolute minimum moves necessary, by winding in and out of a site to be excavated. It's pretty clever and noticably faster.
